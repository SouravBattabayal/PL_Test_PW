Sharding in MongoDB is a data distribution strategy used to horizontally scale a MongoDB database across multiple machines or servers.
It allows MongoDB to handle large amounts of data and high levels of read and write operations by distributing the data across multiple shards (servers or clusters).
Sharding is a key feature that enables MongoDB to scale out and support big data applications with ease.

The functioning of mongo DB is as follow-
 1   Shard key Selection
 2   Sharding Configuration
 3   Data distribution
 4   Query Routing
 5   Scaling
