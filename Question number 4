Promise chaining is a technique in JavaScript that allows you to perform a sequence of asynchronous operations using Promises in a clean and readable manner. 
Instead of nesting multiple levels of callbacks, promise chaining enables you to chain together multiple asynchronous tasks, making the code more maintainable and 
easier to follow.

In JavaScript, a Promise represents a value that might not be available yet but will be resolved or rejected at some point in the future.
A Promise has two possible states: "fulfilled" (resolved with a value) or "rejected" (resolved with an error).
