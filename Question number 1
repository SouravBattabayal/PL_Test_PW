Cookies:
Cookies are small pieces of data stored in the user's web browser. They are typically used for maintaining stateful information across different requests and pages. 
Cookies are sent with every HTTP request to the server, which makes them suitable for storing data that needs to be accessed both on the client-side and server-side.

Key features of cookies:
Size Limit: Cookies can typically store up to 4KB of data.
Expiration: Cookies can have an expiration date, after which they will be automatically removed from the user's browser.
Accessibility: Cookies can be accessed and modified by both the client-side (JavaScript) and server-side (through HTTP headers).

Local Storage:
localStorage is a mechanism that allows developers to store data in the user's browser with no expiration date unless explicitly removed by the user or the website.
It is primarily used for persistent local storage of data that should be available across browser sessions.

Key features of localStorage:
Size Limit: localStorage can typically store up to 5-10 MB of data, depending on the browser.
Expiration: Data stored in localStorage remains until explicitly cleared by the user or the website.
Accessibility: localStorage can be accessed and modified only on the client-side (JavaScript). It is not sent to the server with each HTTP request.

Sesson Storage:
SessionStorage is similar to localStorage but has a crucial difference. While localStorage retains data until cleared by the user or the website, 
sessionStorage keeps data only for the duration of a single browsing session. Once the user closes the browser tab or window, the data stored in sessionStorage is deleted.

Key features of sessionStorage:
Size Limit: sessionStorage has similar size limitations as localStorage (around 5-10 MB).
Expiration: Data stored in sessionStorage persists only for the current session and is cleared when the session ends.
Accessibility: sessionStorage can be accessed and modified only on the client-side (JavaScript) and is not sent to the server with each HTTP request.
