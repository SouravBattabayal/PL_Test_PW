The numbers 1, 4, 3, and 2 will be logged to the console in the following order:

console.log(1);: This is a synchronous call, and it will log 1 to the console first.

console.log(4);: Similarly, this is a synchronous call, and it will log 4 to the console after 1.

setTimeout(function(){console.log(3)}, 0);: This is an asynchronous call using setTimeout. Even though the delay is specified as 0 milliseconds,
it will not execute immediately. Instead, it will be added to the event queue.

setTimeout(function(){console.log(2)}, 1000);: This is another asynchronous call using setTimeout, 
and it has a delay of 1000 milliseconds (1 second). Like the previous setTimeout, it will be added to the event queue.



let's understand the order in which the callbacks will be executed:

The main thread has finished executing all synchronous code (console.log(1) and console.log(4)), and the event loop checks the event queue.
The event loop finds the first setTimeout callback (with the delay of 0 milliseconds) in the event queue. It executes this callback, which logs 3 to the console.
After executing the first setTimeout callback, the event loop checks the event queue again and finds the
second setTimeout callback (with the delay of 1000 milliseconds). Since the required time (1 second) has not yet passed, the event loop waits for the specified time.
After 1 second has passed, the event loop executes the second setTimeout callback, which logs 2 to the console.

The final order of the console logs will be:-
1
4
3
2
