Higher-Order Components (HOCs) in React are a design pattern used for enhancing the functionality and reusability of components. A Higher-Order Component is a function
that takes a component as input and returns a new component with additional props or behavior. HOCs are not a part of React's official API but are a widely used pattern
in React development.

HOCs allow you to abstract common logic or behavior from components and encapsulate it in a separate function. This makes it easier to share functionalities across 
multiple components and promotes code reusability.

Here's how Higher-Order Components work:

 1   Accepting a Component as Input
 2   Returning a New Component
 3   Props Proxy
 4   Composition
