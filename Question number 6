Callback hell, also known as the pyramid of doom, is a situation that arises in asynchronous JavaScript programming when multiple nested callbacks are used one
inside another. This nesting can make the code difficult to read, understand, and maintain. Callback hell typically occurs when dealing with complex asynchronous
operations, such as multiple API calls or database queries.
